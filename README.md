[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation in Go. This implementation considers a finite grid composed by the visible cells only, and so by definition there are no more cells than the ones displayed.

## Usage

Run directly from the project root with `go run life.go`, or build and install with `go install` first and run the binary.

## Note

The purpose of this implementation was to learn Go and its basics, which turned out to be a fun experiment. It should be taken as just that: a learning experiment. It does not attempt to be an optimized version.
